# A UK local authority file (from May 2020) with area insets
This is a very beta version of a UK local authority layer that includes larger insets for 7 parts of the UK. I haven't included everywhere (sorry), just soem of the main urban areas with small areas that are difficult to see on a zoomed out map.

Feel free to use as you see fit.

I have also included bounding boxes with a 10km buffer so that you can add these in to make clear which areas are insets and which are not.
